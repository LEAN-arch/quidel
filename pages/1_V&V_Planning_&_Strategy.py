    Effective planning is the most critical phase of the V&V lifecycle. As the Associate Director, my primary role during this phase is to establish a robust and compliant V&V strategy that aligns with the product's intended use, regulatory pathway, and risk profile. This dashboard is my tool for overseeing the key planning deliverables that form the bedrock of a successful and auditable V&V campaign.

    **Key Responsibilities & Regulatory Imperatives:**
    - **Design and Development Planning (21 CFR 820.30(b)):** This entire page is dedicated to the outputs of the planning process. The V&V Plan, RTM, and Risk-Based approach are core components of our overall design plan.
    - **Requirements Management (ISO 13485, 7.3.3):** The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is the "single source of truth" that demonstrates how we translate user needs and design inputs into verifiable specifications. I use this to ensure 100% requirements coverage.
    - **Risk-Based Approach (ISO 14971):** The V&V strategy must be commensurate with the identified risks. I review the risk analysis to ensure our V&V plan includes specific tests to mitigate high-priority risks and that the depth of testing is justified.
    - **Regulatory Strategy Alignment:** The V&V Plan must generate the specific evidence required for our chosen regulatory pathway (e.g., 510(k), PMA, IVDR). This alignment is critical to avoid delays and additional questions from regulatory bodies.

    The RTM is the backbone of a compliant V&V effort. When I review this matrix, I am verifying several key aspects:
    1.  **Completeness:** Is the coverage 100%? Every single requirement, from user needs to risk controls, MUST have a corresponding test case.
    2.  **Traceability:** Can I trace a requirement forward to its test case and backward from a test result to the requirement it verifies? This bidirectional traceability is essential for audits.
    3.  **Status:** What is the current state of testing? The number of "Fail" results represents our critical path to V&V completion. In this example, the failure of `TC-FLAG-01-03` for a software requirement is a **release blocker** that requires immediate attention from the V&V and development teams.
