    This hub provides me with the tools to actively lead the V&V team through the execution phase and manage our critical cross-functional interactions. My responsibilities extend beyond planning; I must ensure that protocols are executed with integrity, deviations are handled compliantly, my team is supported, and our work products seamlessly integrate into the broader QMS, including the change control process.

    **Key Responsibilities & Regulatory Imperatives:**
    - **V&V Execution & Oversight (21 CFR 820.30(f)):** I oversee the execution of V&V protocols, ensuring data is collected according to Good Documentation Practices (GDP) and that any anomalies or deviations are properly investigated and documented.
    - **Cross-functional Collaboration:** Effective V&V requires tight alignment with R&D, Quality, Regulatory, and Operations. I use this hub to manage our deliverables for design reviews and the Change Control Board (CCB), ensuring V&V's voice is heard.
    - **Audit & Inspection Readiness:** This page tracks the very evidence an auditor will scrutinize: deviation reports, investigation summaries, and ECO records. Maintaining this in a state of readiness is a core leadership function.
    - **Change Control (21 CFR 820.40 & ISO 13485, 7.3.9):** Post-launch changes to released products must be rigorously controlled. I oversee the V&V impact assessment and execution for Engineering Change Orders (ECOs) to ensure we do not adversely affect product performance or safety.

    The treemap provides an immediate visual summary of our post-market V&V workload and bottlenecks. A large red area ('Awaiting V&V Plan') signals that my team is a bottleneck in the change control process, which can delay important product updates. My role in the ECO process is to be the gatekeeper for product quality and regulatory compliance for all post-launch changes. For every proposed change, I or my assigned V&V lead must:
    1.  **Perform an Impact Assessment:** Determine the risk of the change and the extent of V&V testing required.
    2.  **Author and Execute a V&V Plan:** Develop a lean, targeted V&V plan appropriate for the risk level of the change.
    3.  **Provide a Final V&V Report:** Document the results of the testing, providing the objective evidence that the change did not adversely affect the assay's safety or effectiveness.
