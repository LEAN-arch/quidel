    As the Associate Director, my commitment to the Quality Management System (QMS) is non-negotiable. This dashboard is my primary interface for overseeing formal quality events that involve my team, ensuring we meet our compliance obligations and are perpetually "audit-ready." It allows me to manage investigations, monitor CAPA effectiveness, and confidently represent my department's state of control to both internal and external auditors.

    **Key Responsibilities & Regulatory Imperatives:**
    - **CAPA (21 CFR 820.100 & ISO 13485, 8.5.2):** This dashboard provides a consolidated view of all Corrective and Preventive Actions where the V&V team is a key stakeholder. I use this to manage timelines, ensure robust root cause analysis, and verify that corrective actions are implemented and effective.
    - **Nonconformance & Complaint Handling (21 CFR 820.90 & 820.198):** The "Active Investigations" tracker is critical for managing my team's documented response to V&V study anomalies or trends from post-market surveillance before a formal CAPA is initiated.
    - **Audit Support:** This page is designed to be an "auditor's entry point." It provides a clear, real-time status of any V&V-related quality record, demonstrating a controlled process for handling non-conformances and driving continuous improvement.

        Analyzing the origin of quality events is a primary input for **Preventive Action**.
        - **High count from "Post-Launch Complaint Trend":** This is a lagging indicator that our pre-market V&V may have missed a real-world use condition or interaction. **Action:** I will lead a review of our V&V strategy for the implicated product line to enhance our validation protocols, possibly incorporating more real-world samples or stress conditions.
        - **High count from "V&V Study Anomaly":** This is a leading indicator. While it shows our V&V process is effective at finding issues, a trend may suggest a systemic weakness in R&D's design process. **Action:** I will partner with my R&D counterpart to review design transfer criteria and ensure robustness is built in earlier.
        - **"Internal Audit Finding":** This points directly to a gap in our own procedures or training. **Action:** This requires immediate internal process review, potential SOP updates, and documented retraining for my team.
        - **"Contract Lab Deviation":** This highlights a risk in our external partner management. **Action:** I will schedule a quality review meeting with the CRO to discuss their corrective actions and our oversight procedures.
