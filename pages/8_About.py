This application is a high-fidelity simulation of a **V&V Command Center**, a mission-critical tool designed for an **Associate Director of Assay Verification & Validation** at a world-class medical device company like QuidelOrtho.

Its purpose is to translate complex V&V operations, quality system data, and regulatory requirements into a clear, actionable, and auditable management dashboard. It moves beyond simple data tracking to provide strategic insights, enabling a senior leader to manage risk, allocate resources, and ensure unwavering compliance with **FDA 21 CFR 820, ISO 13485, ISO 14971,** and other global regulations.
