    When a test fails to meet its pre-defined acceptance criteria, a formal investigation process is triggered to ensure product quality and regulatory compliance.
    
    1.  **Phase I: Laboratory Investigation**
        *   **Objective:** Confirm if the failure was due to an obvious lab error.
        *   **Steps:**
            *   Check raw data for calculation or transcription errors.
            *   Interview the analyst to confirm correct procedure was followed.
            *   Examine instrument performance logs and calibration records.
            *   Verify reagent expiration and storage conditions.
        *   **Outcome:** If an assignable cause is found, the test is invalidated and repeated. If not, proceed to Phase II.

    2.  **Phase II: Full-Scale Investigation**
        *   **Objective:** Conduct a comprehensive investigation involving Quality Assurance (QA) and other departments.
        *   **Steps:**
            *   A formal Non-conformance Report (NCR) is opened.
            *   Manufacturing is notified to quarantine the batch if applicable.
            *   Investigation expands to review batch records, environmental monitoring, and materials.
            *   Hypothesis testing may be performed to identify the root cause.
        *   **Outcome:** A documented root cause is identified, and a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) is initiated.
