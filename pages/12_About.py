st.markdown("""
This application is a high-fidelity simulation of a **Validation Command Center**, a mission-critical tool designed for a **Manager of Validation Engineering** at a world-class medical device company like QuidelOrtho.

Its purpose is to translate complex validation operations for assays, equipment, and software into a clear, actionable, and auditable management dashboard. It moves beyond simple data tracking to provide strategic, data-scientist-grade insights, enabling a senior leader to manage risk, allocate resources, and ensure unwavering compliance with **FDA 21 CFR 820, ISO 13485, ISO 14971, GAMP 5,** and other global regulations.
