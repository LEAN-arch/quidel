    st.markdown("""
    As the Associate Director, my ultimate responsibility is to ensure that when we submit a new or modified assay to a regulatory body, the V&V section of that submission is complete, robust, and defensible. A weak or incomplete V&V package can lead to costly delays, additional questions (AIs), or even rejection.

    This dashboard is my final "gate check." It provides a consolidated view of all required V&V evidence for a specific project, allowing me to confirm with my V&V Leads and cross-functional partners (Regulatory, QA) that every deliverable is complete and approved before the submission is finalized.

    **Key Responsibilities & Regulatory Imperatives:**
    - **510(k) and PMA Submissions:** This tool directly supports the compilation of these critical regulatory filings by tracking the completion status of all required V&V reports and DHF documents.
    - **FDA Design Control Requirements (21 CFR 820.30):** The checklist below represents the culmination of the entire design control process. Each "Approved" item signifies that the verification and validation activities for that part of the design have been successfully completed and documented in the DHF.
    - **Traceability:** This dashboard ensures that all planned V&V activities, as defined in the V&V Master Plan, have been executed and reported, providing a clear, traceable path for auditors.
