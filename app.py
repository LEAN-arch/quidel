        This enhanced risk plot provides two layers of insight. The central heatmap identifies the highest-scoring individual risks that require immediate action. The **marginal histograms** on the axes reveal systemic trends. For example, a large peak in the top histogram at 'Probable' (4) indicates a systemic issue with recurring, high-probability risks across the portfolio, even if their severity varies. This might signal a need to improve our upstream R&D processes to design out risk earlier.

# --- REGULATORY CONTEXT (EXTENDED) ---
st.divider()
with st.expander("üåê Director's Mandate: The 'Why' Behind This Dashboard", expanded=True):
    st.markdown("""
    As the Associate Director of Assay V&V, my mandate is to ensure every assay and consumable we release is safe, effective, and compliant with global regulations. This Command Center is the embodiment of that mandate, providing the objective evidence needed to manage my team, mitigate risks, and confidently attest to the integrity of our V&V processes during regulatory audits. Each element on this page serves a distinct compliance and management purpose.

    #### **How This Dashboard Demonstrates a State of Control:**

    - **V&V Planning & Strategy (ISO 13485:2016, 7.3.5 & 7.3.6):**
        - The **Portfolio Gantt Chart** is my primary tool for Design and Development Planning. It provides a dynamic, forward-looking view of all V&V workstreams, enabling me to allocate personnel effectively, anticipate resource constraints, and ensure that our activities align with critical business and regulatory submission deadlines. This directly supports the creation of the overarching **V&V Master Plan (VVMP)** for each project.

    - **Risk-Based V&V (ISO 14971:2019 & 21 CFR 820.30(g)):**
        - The **Integrated Risk Management Dashboard** is our live Risk Management File summary. It is a direct output of our risk analysis process (e.g., FMEAs), where we identify potential hazards, estimate and evaluate the associated risks, and control these risks. The 'Unacceptable Region' immediately flags where my team's mitigation efforts and V&V testing depth must be focused to reduce risk "As Low As Reasonably Practicable" (ALARP).

    - **Executive Oversight & Management by Exception:**
        - The **Executive KPIs** distill the complex status of the entire portfolio into actionable insights. They allow me to immediately identify projects that are off-track or risks that have breached our action thresholds, enabling me to manage by exception and focus my attention where it is most needed.

    - **Regulatory Strategy Alignment (FDA 510(k), PMA & EU IVDR):**
        - This dashboard is designed from the ground up to be "audit-ready." It serves as a master index for our V&V-related Design History File (DHF) contributions and ensures alignment of V&V evidence with the specific requirements of different regulatory pathways, including the General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) of IVDR.
